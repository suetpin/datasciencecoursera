## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit 
## to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. The 
## following two functions(makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve) are used to cache the 
## inverse of a matrix.

## makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", 
## which is really a list containing a function to
## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the inverse of the matrix
## get the value of the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## The cacheSolve function returns the inverse of the special "matrix"
## which created with the makeCacheMatrix function.
## It first checks if the inverse has already been computed.
## If so, it gets the result and skips the computation.
## Else, it computes the inverse of the matrix and 
## sets the value in the cache via the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(inv)
  inv
}
